# Database Backup Implementation

Automated daily backups of PostgreSQL database to S3 bucket for disaster recovery

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Create GitHub Actions workflow for daily database backups
- [x] Configure retention policy to keep 14 days of backups
- [x] Set up timestamp naming for backups
- [x] Add AWS credential configuration using GitHub secrets
- [x] Configure S3 bucket upload functionality
- [x] Allow manual triggering via workflow_dispatch
- [x] Update workflow to perform backups on the remote server using SSH

## In Progress Tasks
- [ ] Test the workflow with a manual trigger
- [ ] Verify backup file retention policy works correctly

## Future Tasks
- [ ] Consider adding notification on backup failure
- [ ] Implement backup restoration procedure
- [ ] Create documentation for backup and restore procedures
- [ ] Consider adding backup encryption

## Implementation Plan
The database backup system uses GitHub Actions to create and manage daily backups of the PostgreSQL database. The workflow runs at midnight UTC every day and performs the following steps:

1. Generates a timestamp for the backup filename
2. Configures AWS credentials from GitHub secrets
3. Connects to the production server via SSH
4. Creates a PostgreSQL dump from the running database container
5. Uploads the backup to the specified S3 bucket directly from the server
6. Cleans up old backups to maintain a 14-day retention policy

The system uses the following GitHub secrets for authentication:
- GH_AWS_ACCESS_KEY
- GH_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
- GH_AWS_BUCKET_NAME
- GH_AWS_REGION
- TESTNET_DEPLOY_HOST
- TESTNET_DEPLOY_USER
- TESTNET_DEPLOY_KEY
